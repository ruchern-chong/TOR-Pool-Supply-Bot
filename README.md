TOR is a truly algorithmic stablecoin built on the Fantom Opera Chain. It has a dynamic supply which is determined by supply and demand which ensures it is always worth $1.

## What is this bot about?
This bot is to track the TOR supply on the [Curve Liquidity Pool](https://ftm.curve.fi/factory/62/deposit) and its balance against the DAI + USDC Supply.
